My name is Ellaine. (Yes, it's Elaine with 2 L's üòÑ). I am a Full stack Software Engineer based from Silicon Valley with a Bachelor of Science in Interior Design degree from the [University of Santo Tomas (Philippines)](http://www.ust.edu.ph/academics/programs/bachelor-of-science-in-interior-design/) and more than 8 years of hospitality experience.

Having that design and hospitality background, I find Software Engineering interesting because it aligns with user experience and creativity. I love building and seeing projects come to life. Front-end Development is my fave! I am looking forward in producing creative and interesting products that will serve as a great contribution to the community.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on my portfolio.
- üå± I‚Äôm trying to learn more about ReactJS, Data structures, and responsive web design.
- :bulb: Fun fact: I am a percussion aficionado, but my most favorite instruments are drums ü•Å and :guitar:.

- üòÑ Pronouns: She/They
