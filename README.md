## Mabuhay! I'm Ellaine! 👋

I am a Full stack Software Engineer based from Silicon Valley with a Bachelor of Science in Interior Design degree from the [University of Santo Tomas (Philippines)](http://www.ust.edu.ph/academics/programs/bachelor-of-science-in-interior-design/) and more than 8 years of hospitality experience. 

Having that design and hospitality background, I find Software Engineering interesting because it aligns with user experience and creativity. I love building and seeing projects come to life. Front-end Development is my fave! I am looking forward in producing creative and interesting products that will serve as a great contribution to the community.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m trying to learn more about ReactJS, React Hooks, Redux and responsive web design.
- :bulb: Fun fact: I am a percussion aficionado, but my most favorite instruments are drums 🥁 and :guitar:.

- 😄 Pronouns: She/They
